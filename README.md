## Project: Read from Azure SQL Database from DevOps using federated credentials

**Project Description**: This project will read from a table in SQL Database, connecting using a token for federated credentials.

## Create pipeline

* Create new project in Azure DevOps.

* Create pipeline then connect to existing repo in GitHub and select YAML file.

* In the Project Settings, create service connection to your Azure Subscription called azure_connection:

This creates App registration with Federated credentials. Please note this is a POC so creating the App registration is fine, however, in Production it is likely that this will be performed separately prior to the creation of the pipeline.

## Add App registration to the SQL Database:

```
-- in master database
CREATE LOGIN [<display name of App registration>]  FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
GO
CREATE USER [<display name of App registration>]  FROM LOGIN [<display name of App registration>];
GO

-- in user database
CREATE USER [<display name of App registration>]  FROM LOGIN [<display name of App registration>];
GO
ALTER ROLE db_owner ADD MEMBER [<display name of App registration>];
GO
```
